      <b>Introduction: </b><p>Clouds is a user interface design for a clean and simple weather mobile app.
        The Users will be able to receive essential weather information without accessing multiple pages.</p>

    <p><b>Problem: </b>Many weather mobile apps provide extra information that users do not find useful or interesting.
      Some apps have complicated designs that are not visually appealing to some users. </p>

    <h2>Concept</h2>
    <p>
      - Use uniform colors on text to achieve simple and clean appearance.<br>
      - Demonstrate current state of weather with different color backgrounds.<br>
      - Shows date and time location on top of the screen, current weather information in the middle, and
        weather information in the future time at the bottom.<br>
    </p>

    <h1>Concept Design Problems</h1>
    <p>
      - The spaces are not being used efficiently, the information in the middle of the screen looks cramped together. <br>
      - The emphasis of the temperature does not display the current weather type to the users.<br>
      - The color representations for day time are too bright, the information becomes unreadable.<br>
      - The placement of the current location does not fit into the group of weather information.<br>
      - The line graph used to represent future weather information does not represent and display the weather information.<br>
    </p>
    <h1>Improved Design Concept</h1>
    <p>
      - The information of current location and date are being grouped on top of the screen.<br>
      - Use weather icons/visualizations as an emphasis to display the current weather.<br>
      - The detailed weather information is more spaced out and more readable.<br>
      - Use weather icons to display the future weather information rather than a line graph.<br>
