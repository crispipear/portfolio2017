    <h1>Overview</h1>
    <p>Waves is a conceptual public installation using holographic technology integrated with a mobile application. The mobile application
    provides a safe place and a healthy gateway for people, especially students, to deal with stress. The public installation will
    raise awareness that stress is common and there are probably people out there experiencing similar issues.
    As an end goal, Waves hopes to encourage people to deal with stress openly.

    <h1>My Role</h1>
    <p>I collaborated with three other teammates to produce a high fidelity video prototype exploring a social issue through interactive media art and design.
      We worked together to research and conceptualize the ideas to capture the user experience through storytelling. I was also responsible for developing the mobile prototype
      in Objective C and post video production.

      <h2 class="col-12">Problem</h2>
      <p class="col-12">Mental health is an underlying issue within our society. While depression is one of the highest cause suicidal deaths among youth, stress is also a mental health issue among the general public especially students. College students often feel anxious
        and stressed trying to balance school, work, friends and family while also trying to figure out other life problems. Since stress is common in the society, people usually don't see stress as a serious mental health issue and therefore not deal
        with properly.</p>

      <p class="col-12">Study has shown that sharing thoughts is a healthy way to deal with stress. Waves is a public installation that integrates with a mobile application
        to provide a safe space for people who are dealing with stress to share their thoughts.
        The goals of the Waves installation are to demonstrate that stress is all around us and encourage the public to deal with stress.</p>

      <h2>Public Installation Concept</h2>
      <p>The installation not only visuliazes user submissions to bring the awareness of stress to the public, but also encourage others to share their thoughts. The Waves table stimulates a pool of water waves as a metaphorical representation of waves of
        stress. The activity of the waves depend on the selected wave level has been sent through the mobile application.

      <h2 class="col-12">Mobile App Concept</h2>
      <p class="col-12">The mobile app acts as a gateway to allow people to share their thoughts and stress anonymously. The anonymity of the app creates a safe place that allows the users to share what is making them anxious and frustrated. In addition, the app also includes
        suggestions for distress methods. Users will be able to see what other "waves" are being submitted, view history and comfort messages being sent back to their own submitted waves.</p>
