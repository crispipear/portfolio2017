      <h2>Problem</h2>
      <p>Climate change is a global issue in our society. While the issue has brought many environmental impacts to the planet we are living on, it also
      brought social problems to the community. It is not apparent to the public that the impacts of climate change is not the same for everyone.
      The <b>Climate Gap</b> is a social problem where existing social economic, and health disparities mean that
      racial minorities and low-income communities are both more likely to be affected by and have a harder time adapting to new climate realities

      <p>Communities who are impacted by the climate gap are vulnerable to the impacts of climate change due to social and economic status. For example,
      the low-income demographic groups will less likely to afford housing in communities that are cleaner with ammenties to relieve heat waves.</p>

      <h2>What is "Murder in Imdy"?</h2>
      <p>"Murder in Imdy" is an alternate reality game that encourages the player to solve a murder happened in a fictional town "Imdy" over the death of
      Tobias Kowalski (fictional character). Players will unravel the story behind the murder mystery not only to discover the truth of his death, but also the
      social impacts on the people of Imdy due to corporations malpractice and climate change.</p>
      <h2>My Role</h2>
      <p>As the lead on marketing and campaign, I was responsible to oversee the process and products for marketing to promote our alternate reality game. I worked together with
        few other team members to create a plan and outline for marketing strategies and execute the ideas.
        I was also responsible for video production, web design/development and create the physical props that was used in the game.</p>

      <h2>Branding: Color Scheme</h2>
      <p>The purpose of the anti-establishment today is to bring the power back to the people versus the corporations.
        For the main color scheme, we decided to go with the four colors shown above. Dark colors (black) are used to represent strength and rebellion. The blue and green are used in the symbolism of environment and protection of Earth.</p>

      <h2>Branding: Logo</h2>
      <p>Collaborated with Rutuja Nehra. Bird spirit is a symbolism of freedom, air and earth. The crow is a symbolism representing the creatures residing in the local wetlands near the UW Bothell campus, while it also
      symbolizes wisdom. Delta symbolizes the call for change and the bird taking off stance represents call for action.</p>

      <h2>Marketing Strategies</h2>
      <p>The three main mediums for the game marketing campaign are <b>website</b>, <b>printed media</b> and <b>social media</b>. Instead of bluntly telling the public to play the game, we hope to utilize the game narrative in all the marketing mediums. Our main goal for the marketing campaign is to engage the public audience and create a more immersive experience even before the they get to play the game. The public audience will be able to get the previews of the game narrative and gameplay hints through the marketing campaign.</p>
      <h3 class="col-12">Social Media</h3>
      <p>Objective: Immerse players with the perspectives of the fictional characters.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/tobikowalski/" target="_blank" class="underline">Instagram</a>: Marketing team will be posting as Tobi (fictional character, victim) through a timeline up until his day of death.
        The posts on the instagram will be used as a hint of locations that the victim has attended as a source of investigation.
        Tobi will also post like other daily life events to create a more realistic vibe on the character.</p>
      <p><a href="https://twitter.com/nadiakowalski18" target="_blank" class="underline">Twitter</a>: Marketing team will be posting as Nadia (fictional character, victim’s family member). Similar to Tobi,
          Nadia’s account will also be posting daily life events to create a more realistic feel to the character.
          There will be posts about Tobi’s death and rants on seeking for truth.
